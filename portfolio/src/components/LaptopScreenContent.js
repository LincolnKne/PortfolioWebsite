              I am a Software Engineering student at Iowa State University with
              a planned graduation in May 2025. Starting at Iowa State I was in
              the Aerospace Engineering Program which had lasted 2 years. In
              that time, I had taken a few classes over topics like <b>Python</b>{' '}
              and <b>MATLAB</b>. Towards the end of the two years I had found
              out that Aerospace was not for me which led me to pivot to
              Software Engineering as I had enjoyed the coding classes I had
              taken. <br /> <br />
              Now I am going into my senior year as a Software Engineering
              student, and I have worked on a variety of different projects.
              Many of the projects were team-based and solo-based projects. This
              has trained me to be able to understand how the process of working
              on a project differs from in class to real-world scenarios. I have
              done coursework with <b>Java</b>, <b>C/C++</b>, <b>HTML/CSS</b>,{' '}
              <b>Javascript</b>, <b>React</b>, <b>Android Studio</b>, and{' '}
              <b>Intellij</b>.<br /> <br />
              My main focus prior to my senior year has been interning at Nestle
              Purina in Clinton, Iowa. I have enjoyed my time as I have been
              working on web development, and creating a product in <b>React</b>{' '}
              that I am proud of as well as a product that Nestle Purina can
              find easily accessible and efficient.
